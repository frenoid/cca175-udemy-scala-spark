Problem statement

1) /user/root/retail_db/orders
2) /user/root/retail_db/order_items

Data for products is available locally under /data/retail_db/products

Final output needs to be stored under
1) HDFS location - avro format: /user/root/daily_revenue_avro_scala
2) HDFS location - text format: /user/root/daily_revenue_txt_scala
3) Local location /home/root/daily_revenue_scala
4) Solution needs to be stored under /home/root/daily_revenue_scala.txt
